# Probability Calculator Python Application
Python Project for Calculating Disease Probability


The purpose of this project is to predict the probability of contracting AIDS based on various features such as age, weight, and type of treatment in the dataset.

The AI model is first trained by providing it with the data, and later the results are tested with test data to check the accuracy of the predictions.

This dataset was published in 1996 and contains health statistics and categorical information of patients with AIDS.
